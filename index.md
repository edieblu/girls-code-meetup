## So you want to become a web developer. What's next?

A web developer builds and maintains content for the web, including different devices, such as desktop, tablets and smartphones. 
__Front-end__ developers work with languages that render in the browser (also called a client). Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer are all __clients__. Front-end developers primarily work with __HTML, CSS and Javascript__.

Some websites require a special server (a big computer that _serves_ information) because certain content has to be customized for each user based on their data (for example, if the user is logged in or not). To develop that you will need to become a __back-end developer__ (because most of the action is happening at the back, you can't see it, unlike front-end, where any changes can be seen in the browser). 

Those who work with both front-end and back-end technologies, are called __full-stack developers__. A __stack__ is the set of tools (both front-end and back-end) that a company uses to build it's website. 

You aren't expected to know all of the technologies and programming languages out there, but everyone should know the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

###HTML
__HTML__ stands for __HyperText Markup Language__. It describes the content of the website as well as its structure (what is a title, what is a paragraph and what is a list etc). __HyperText__ means that you can jump from one document to the other, or from one part of the webiste to the other (think Wikipedia), by clicking links. 
__Markup language__ means that you need to use a set of tags to define the structure of the language. Tags look like this < > with some text in between. HTML files are saved in a file ending with .html. 

###CSS
__CSS__ stands for __Cascading Style Sheet__ and is the design of the website. With CSS you can set the background colour, create a specific layout (columns) and even do some fancy animation. Like HTML CSS has a specific syntax, instead of tags < > you will use a lot of curly braces { }. CSS files end with .css. So, if HTML is the content, the words of the website, CSS will determine how the website looks like stylistically. To see powerful exapmles of CSS, checkout [CSS Zen Garden] (http://www.csszengarden.com/) - you'll see websites using exactly the same HTML, but using different styles or CSS.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/edieblu/girls-code-meetup/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
