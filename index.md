## So you want to become a web developer. What's next?

A web developer builds and maintains content for the web, including different devices, such as desktop, tablets and smartphones. 
__Front-end__ developers work with languages that render in the browser (also called a client). Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer are all __clients__. Front-end developers primarily work with __HTML, CSS and Javascript__.

Some websites require a special server (a big computer that _serves_ information) because certain content has to be customized for each user based on their data (for example, if the user is logged in or not). To develop that you will need to become a __back-end developer__ (because most of the action is happening at the back, you can't see it, unlike front-end, where any changes can be seen in the browser OR client:). 

Those who work with both front-end and back-end technologies, are called __full-stack developers__. A __stack__ is simply the set of tools (both front-end and back-end) that a company uses to build it's website. 

You aren't expected to know all of the technologies and programming languages out there, but everyone should know the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

### HTML
__HTML__ stands for __HyperText Markup Language__. It describes the content of the website as well as its structure (what is a title, what is a paragraph and what is a list etc). HTML is the nouns of the website. __HyperText__ means that you can jump from one document to the other, or from one part of the webiste to the other (think Wikipedia), by clicking links. 
__Markup language__ means that you need to use a set of tags to define the structure of the language. Tags look like this < > with some text in between. HTML files are saved in a file ending with .html. 

HTML looks like this:
```
<h1>My Super Personal Web Diary</h1>
<p>Dear Diary, today was a really sucky day.</p>
```

### CSS
__CSS__ stands for __Cascading Style Sheet__ and is the design of the website. CSS is the adjectives of the website. With CSS you can set the background colour, create a specific layout (columns) and even do some fancy animation. Like HTML CSS has a specific syntax, instead of tags < > you will use a lot of curly braces { }. CSS files end with .css. So, if HTML is the content, the words of the website, CSS will determine how the website looks like stylistically. To see some impressive examples of CSS, checkout [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) - you'll see websites using exactly the same HTML, but using different styles or CSS (You won't believe how different those websites can be!).

CSS looks like this:
```
h1 {
color:pink;
font-size: 44px;
}
```

### Javascript
Now on to Javascript. Javascript is responsible for managing interaction within a browser. Javascript is the verbs of a website. Javascript is not just for front-end developers, even 50% of back-end developers say they use some form of Javascript daily. Javascript helps you load and unload media, create & modify & delete elements on the page and more! Javasccript files end with .js.

This is how Javascript looks like:
```
var title = document.getElementByQuerySelector("h1").color = "blue"  // this will change the color of our header to blue (from pink).
```
### Back-end
We want get into back-end technologies too much here. If you want to learn more you can either ask one of our coaches or do a quick search online. A good way to start is a learning PHP (server-side scripting) and SQL (database language).
