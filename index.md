## So you want to become a web developer. What's next?

### What is a web developer
A web developer builds and maintains content for the web, including different devices, such as desktop, tables and handheld mobile devices. Front-end developers work with languages that render in the browser (also called a client). Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer are all clients. Front-end developers primarily work with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Some websites require a special server because certain content has to be customized for each user based on their data (for example, if the user is logged in or not). To do that you will need to become a back-end developer (because most of the action is happening at the back, you can't see it, unlike front-end, where any changes can be seen once you open the website). 

If can master both front-end and back-end technologies, you can be called a full-stack developer. A stack is the set of tools (both front-end and back-end) that a company uses to build it's website. 

You aren't expected to know all of the technologies and languages out there, but everyone should know the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

HTML
stands or HyperText Markup Language. It describes the content of the website as well as a structure (what is a title, what is a paragraph and what is a list etc). HyperText means that you can jump from one document to the other, by clicking links. 
Markup language means that you need to use a set of tags to define the structure of the language. For example <p> means paragraph, <strong> means bold and <br> means a line break. 
  
CSS
